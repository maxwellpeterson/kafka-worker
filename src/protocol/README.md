# Protocol

This folder contains files related to the Kafka wire protocol and internal wire protocol. The `kafka` folder contains files specific to the Kafka protocol, and the `internal` folder contains files specific to the internal protocol.

The files in the root of this folder contain code that is shared across both protocols, which use the same primitives and message structure.
