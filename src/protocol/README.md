# Protocol

This folder contains files related to the Kafka wire protocol and internal wire protocol. Files specific to the Kafka protocol are in the `kafka` folder, and files specific to the internal protocol are in the `internal` folder.

The files in the root of this folder contain code that is shared across both protocols, which use the same primitives and message structure.
